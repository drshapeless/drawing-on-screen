* Drawing on screen
This is a series of different example to draw something on screen,
from simple to hardcore.

* Library
The base library is SDL2  (maybe SDL3 once it is released), I don't
want to handle the cross platform staffs myself.

We will start by using the built-in SDL functions to render some
rectangles. Slowly proceed to using OpenGL and Vulkan. Meanwhile, we
may explore something on the web, touch a bit of WebGPU.

* Language
The language of choice would be C++, although I like C very much, for
a learning purpose, C++ is a much better choice.

Later, we may do something interesting in Rust and Zig.

* Games
We are going to build some games to place something on screen.

The order would be in the [[gamelist.org][game list]].
